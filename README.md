# purchases-forecasting

In this notebook, a simple deep learning-based predictive model is created, which is able to predict whether a customer will purchase a good or not based on various feature variables. It consists of three parts:

1. The necessary packages are loaded, and the dataset is imported, analyzed and preprocessed.
2. The predictive model is generated and trained.
3. The model is evaluated using the AUC.
